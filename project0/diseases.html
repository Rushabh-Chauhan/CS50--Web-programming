    <h1>Disease</h1>
    <p>
        A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of
        an organism,
        and that is not due to any immediate external injury. Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are
        associated
        with specific symptoms and signs. A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal
        dysfunctions.
        for example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including
        various forms
        of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies and autoimmune disorders.

            <h2 id="section1.1">Concepts</h2>
            <p>
                In many cases, terms such as disease, disorder, morbidity, sickness and illness are used
                interchangeably; however,
                there are situations when specific terms are considered preferable.
            </p>
            <h3>Disease</h3>
            <p>
                The term disease broadly refers to any condition that impairs the normal functioning of the body. For
                this reason,
                diseases are associated with dysfunctioning of the body's normal homeostatic processes. Commonly, the
                term is used to
                refer specifically to infectious diseases, which are clinically evident diseases that result from the
                presence of
                pathogenic microbial agents, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, multicellular organisms, and
                aberrant
                proteins known as prions. An infection or colonization that does not and will not produce clinically
                evident impairment
                of normal functioning, such as the presence of the normal bacteria and yeasts in the gut, or of a
                passenger virus, is not
                considered a disease. By contrast, an infection that is asymptomatic during its incubation period, but
                expected to produce
                symptoms later, is usually considered a disease. Non-infectious diseases are all other diseases,
                including most forms of cancer,
                heart disease, and genetic disease.
            </p>
            <h3>Acquired disease</h3>
            <p>
                An acquired disease is one that began at some point during one's lifetime, as opposed to disease that
                was already
                present at birth, which is congenital disease. Acquired sounds like it could mean "caught via
                contagion", but it simply
                means acquired sometime after birth. It also sounds like it could imply secondary disease, but acquired
                disease can be primary
                disease.
            </p>
            <h3>Acute disease</h3>
            <p>
                An acute disease is one of a short-term nature (acute); the term sometimes also connotes a fulminant
                nature.
            </p>
            <h3>Chronic condition or chronic disease</h3>
            <p>A chronic disease is one that persists over time, often characterized as at least six months but may also
                include
                illnesses that are expected to last for the entirety of one's natural life.

            <h3>Mental</h3>
            <p>
                Mental illness is a broad, generic label for a category of illnesses that may include affective or emotional instability, 
                behavioral dysregulation, cognitive dysfunction or impairment. Specific illnesses known as mental illnesses include major 
                depression, generalized anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, to name a few. 
                Mental illness can be of biological (e.g., anatomical, chemical, or genetic) or psychological (e.g., trauma or conflict)  
                origin. It can impair the affected person's ability to work or study and can harm interpersonal relationships. The term  
                insanity is used technically as a legal term.
            </p>

            <h3>Organic</h3>
            <p>
                An organic disease is one caused by a physical or physiological change to some tissue or organ of the body. The term sometimes 
                excludes infections. It is commonly used in contrast with mental disorders. It includes emotional and behavioral disorders if they 
                are due to changes to the physical structures or functioning of the body, such as after a stroke or a traumatic brain injury, but not 
                if they are due to psychosocial issues.
